# OptionsBot

I love loosing money in the stock market, and when I discovered options, I could see the bright future of eating out of trashcans that I wanted.

However, I ran into a huge problem... I had to research stocks that would lose me money. pshh, I will take none of that. Thats valuable time I could be using to waste my hard earned money elsewhere. 

So I decided I wanted to try to create a bot to trade for me
------------------------------------------------------------

All jokes aside, I am not a financial advisor and this trading bot was for research purposes only. I do not want anyone to use this code for actual options trades. dont be like me. 

I have a few goals for this project:
   1) I want to collect historical option data from the top 100 stocks and store it in a postgreSQL database.
   2) create functions for common trading strategies such as: The wheel, Iron condor, credit spreads, married puts, straddles, etc. 
   3) compare the backtested P/L to the S&P 500
   4) Optomize code so I can eventually link my profile and eventually get/lose money. (I will post my gains or losses so everyone understands)

Currently it is May 10 2022 and we are in one of the largest bear markets in a while. and well many trading stategies get tied up in this sort of market.

These goals will probably change througout the project while I learn. So make sure you check previous commits. 

That is all, may the funny haha games begin. And lets all pray to the boys on r/WallStreetBets that my tendies are high an mighty.
